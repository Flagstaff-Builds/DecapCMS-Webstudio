  There is no reason for this blog post to exist.
  And yet, here we are.
  You. Me. Words on a screen.

  We could be reading something useful.
  Learning something new.
  Eating snacks.

  But instead, you’re reading this —
  a monument to digital air.

  Maybe it’s art.
  Maybe it’s filler.
  Maybe it’s your new favorite post.

  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
