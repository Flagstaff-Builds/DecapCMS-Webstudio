  Poem from AI - ugh

  Some days, doing nothing is everything.

  No ambition. No checklist. No deep thoughts.

  You sit. You blink. You exist.


  This blog is dedicated to that quiet void.

  Not the “mindful meditation” type of nothing.

  Just actual nothing.



  The clock ticks.

  Your brain flatlines.

  Bliss.

  Anyway, that’s it.
