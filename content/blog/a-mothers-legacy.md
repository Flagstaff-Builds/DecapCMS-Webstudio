  It is <strong>Mother's Day</strong>, and I can say without hesitation that my proudest title and my greatest joy has been being called "Mom."


  This picture I carry holds more than faces. It holds stories and feelings that have shaped my life. I was the youngest of thirteen children. Yes, thirteen. Nine boys and four girls. My mom had me at forty-four, and I knew from a very young age that my time with her would be short. That awareness made me intentional with every moment I had.


  She was there for me in both the brightest and hardest days. She met my two children. She steadied me through long months of <strong>postpartum depression</strong>. She cared for my little ones while I was in the hospital, again and again. She gave me the gift of time to heal, without fear or guilt. My recovery was possible because of her love, and I will always carry gratitude for that.


  She has been gone nearly twenty-six years now. My daughter, thirty, is a mother herself to two boys. My son, twenty-eight, continues to find his way in the world. Time stands still for no one.


  This day reminds me to say aloud what too often goes unspoken: <strong>love must be expressed, not stored away</strong>. Not only today, but every day.


  To all the mothers, may you be blessed to feel loved and cherished daily. It is the most important work and the most enduring title any of us will ever hold.
