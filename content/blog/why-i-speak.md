  I never set out to be a speaker. I just started sharing honest, personal
  stories about growing up on the prairies, raising a family, and finding hope
  in unexpected places.


  Over time, I saw how those stories weren’t just mine. They were echoes of what other people had lived through, too.


  I speak because connection matters.


  I speak because sometimes someone in the room needs to know they’re not alone.


  And I speak because we all need encouragement now and then, the kind that feels real.
