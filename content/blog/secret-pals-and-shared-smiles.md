  Yesterday was a day that filled my heart. It was one I had circled on the calendar and carried with anticipation. The reason was simple: the <strong>Secret Pal Pizza Party</strong> at our local Paintearth Lodge.


  Two years ago, with the help of our Castor & District Family Community Support Services and funding from the Rural Mental Health Network, I started a program to connect seniors and students through letter writing. At first, I wasn't sure how it would be received. But I knew how powerful the act of writing a letter could be. For many seniors, it was once their only form of communication. For students, it was something entirely new.


  Thanks to the Lodge Recreation Coordinator and an enthusiastic Grade 7/8 teacher, the idea took root. Letters began to pass back and forth, signed with playful names like <em>Mickey and Minnie</em> or <em>Adam and Eve</em>. Stories were shared that might otherwise have been lost. Seniors received something in the mail other than bills. Students discovered the simple joy of pen and paper. And both groups gained a friend they didn't yet know by face.


  Yesterday, the waiting ended. Secret Pals met one another over slices of pizza. The smiles were infectious, the conversations lively, and the connections complete.


  My heart was full. And I know I wasn't the only one.


  <strong>Sometimes the smallest gestures — a letter, a story, a shared laugh — can weave generations together.</strong>
