  Back in May, I shared how I was beginning training with <strong>Togetherall</strong>, a peer-to-peer mental health support platform. It felt like opening a new door â€” one that invited learning, reflection, and the chance to contribute to a community built on care.


  Today, I'm happy to share that I've completed my role as a <strong>Peer Mentor</strong> there. The journey has been more than just a course or a credential. It has been a reminder of the power of listening, the importance of empathy, and the quiet strength that comes when people feel understood.


  <strong>Growth rarely happens all at once.</strong> Often it comes in steps, like a path winding through seasons. What began as curiosity in May has now become another way I can support others in their mental health journey.


  I'm grateful for the opportunity, and hopeful for the connections yet to come.
