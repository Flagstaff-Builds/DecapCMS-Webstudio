excerpt: Out here, we’re used to things not going quite as planned, but that’s
  where the best stories come from.

  One January evening, the power cut out during one of the coldest nights of the
  year. We bundled up in quilts and lit oil lamps, and somehow, those few hours
  without electricity brought us closer than an entire week of being “plugged
  in.”


  It’s funny how moments of inconvenience become the stories we cherish most.


  In my talks, I often draw on these little experiences to remind people of resilience and the importance of staying connected to each other when the lights go out.
