  ## It’s been quiet lately.


  Not the kind of quiet that makes you feel lonely, but the kind that settles in like an old quilt—familiar and steady. You hear it in the gaps between birdsong and the sound of a screen door clicking shut. You notice it when you stop rushing.


  The trees out back are greening up fast now. A week ago they were just budding, and now the whole ridge behind the house looks like it exhaled all at once. It’s the same every year, but somehow it always catches me off guard—how suddenly life returns to the edges.


  I’ve been sitting on the porch more. Just listening. The breeze rattles the chimes a bit, the neighbor’s dog lets out a half-hearted bark now and then, and that’s about it. You’d think not much is happening, but somehow the stillness fills you up.


  I used to feel like I needed to be doing something all the time—scrubbing a counter, answering a message, making a list of things that needed to be done. But the older I get, the more I’ve come to appreciate the space in between. The slow days. The pauses.


  ### That’s where a lot of the good stuff lives.


  This morning I heard the first lawnmower of the season fire up across the road. That sound always brings a smile—makes me think of fresh starts, of summer days ahead, of people puttering in yards with cold drinks nearby. It reminded me that even in the quiet, life keeps moving. Just at its own pace.


  And maybe that’s the point.


  We don’t always need to push it along. Sometimes, the best thing we can do is let it unfold, one slow morning at a time.
