  There’s something about a kitchen table that makes people open up.


  Growing up in rural Alberta, I learned that life’s big questions often got talked out over a pot of coffee and a plate of something sweet. That table wasn’t just for meals — it was a space for prayer, planning, laughter, and even tears.


  As I travel and speak, I still carry that image with me. I want every presentation to feel like we’re gathered around a table, sharing life and learning from one another.


  You don’t need fancy words or a microphone to make a difference — just a listening ear and a place to sit.
