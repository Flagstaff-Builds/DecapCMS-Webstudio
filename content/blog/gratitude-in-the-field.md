  Harvest is a season that tests both endurance and spirit. The hours are long, the work demanding, and sometimes the smallest kindness can carry you further than you thought possible.


  Today, that kindness came in the form of lunch in the field, thanks to <strong>Iva Harberg</strong> and the team at <strong>FCC Camrose</strong>. Their support means more than a full stomach â€” it's a reminder that farming is never done alone. Behind every operation are neighbors, partners, and friends who help lighten the load.


  As combines move steadily across the rows and trucks rumble down gravel roads, moments like this stand out. A meal shared on the tailgate, a laugh carried on the wind, and the reassurance that others see the work you're doing.


  <strong>Gratitude has a way of turning an ordinary day in the field into something memorable.</strong> And today, my heart is full.
