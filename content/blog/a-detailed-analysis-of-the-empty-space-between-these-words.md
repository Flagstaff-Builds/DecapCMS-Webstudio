  Let’s talk about the real star of this sentence: the spaces.
  Invisible. Underappreciated. Necessary.

  Each one…
  A pause.
  A breath.
  A metaphor for everything and nothing.

  Do they mean anything? No.
  Could they mean something? Also no.

  This is not a metaphor for life.
  This is just whitespace.
  And this blog exists to honor it.

  Thank you for your time.
