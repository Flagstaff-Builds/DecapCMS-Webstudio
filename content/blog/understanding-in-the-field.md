  When my husband and I reached out for help, one thing made all the difference: having an <strong>ag-informed therapist</strong>. Farming is a unique lifestyle, woven with challenges that are hard to explain even on the best of days. In times of struggle, those challenges can feel impossible to put into words for someone who has never lived them.


  That is why it matters so deeply to have professionals who understand the rhythms of farm life. The long hours. The weather worries. The generational expectations. The endless list of tasks that never seem to wait for a good time. To speak with someone who truly "gets it" is to feel less alone, less misunderstood, and more hopeful.


  I'm encouraged to see a growing movement to make this kind of support more accessible. <strong>Producers and their families deserve care that reflects the reality of their lives.</strong> Because when mental health is strengthened, so too are the farms, the families, and the communities that depend on them.


  This work matters. And I'm grateful to see it moving forward.
